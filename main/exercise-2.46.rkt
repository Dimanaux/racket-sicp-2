; Exercise 2.46.
; A two-dimensional vector v running from the origin to a
; point can be represented as a pair consisting of an
; x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. Implement a data
; abstraction for vectors by giving a constructor make-vect
; and corresponding selectors xcor-vect and ycor-vect. In
; terms of your selectors and constructor, implement
; procedures add-vect, sub-vect, and scale-vect that
; perform the operations vector addition, vector
; subtraction, and multiplying a vector by a scalar:

; (x1, y1) + (x2,y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)
; (x1, y1) − (x2,y2) = (x1 − x2, y1 − y2)
; s * (x, y) = (sx, sy)

(provide
  make-vect xcor-vect ycor-vect
  add-vect sub-vect scale-vect)

(define (make-vect x y)
  (cons x y))

(define (xcor-vect v)
  (car v))

(define (ycor-vect v)
  (cdr v))

(define (add-vect a b)
  (make-vect
    (+ (xcor-vect a) (xcor-vect b))
    (+ (ycor-vect a) (ycor-vect b)))))

(define (sub-vect a b)
  (make-vect
    (- (xcor-vect a) (xcor-vect b))
    (- (ycor-vect a) (ycor-vect b))))

(define (scale-vect vect factor)
  (make-vect
    (* (xcor-vect vect) factor)
    (* (ycor-vect vect) factor)))
