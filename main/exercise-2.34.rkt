; Exercise 2.34.
; Evaluating a polynomial in x at a given value of x can be
; formulated as an accumulation. We evaluate the polynomial
; a[n] * x^n + a[n-1] * x^(n-1) + ... + a[1] * x + a[0]

; using a well-known algorithm called Horner's rule, which
; structures the computation as
; (...(a[n] * x + a[nâˆ’1]) * x + ... + a1) * x + a0

; In other words, we start with a[n], multiply by x, add
; a[n-1], multiply by x, and so on, until we reach a0. Fill
; in the following template to produce a procedure that
; evaluates a polynomial using Horner's rule. Assume that
; the coefficients of the polynomial are arranged in a
; sequence, from a[0] through a[n].

; (define (horner-eval x coefficient-sequence)
;   (accumulate (lambda (this-coeff higher-terms) <??>)
;               0
;               coefficient-sequence))

; For example, to compute 1 + 3x + 5x^3 + x^5 at x = 2 you
; would evaluate (horner-eval 2 (list 1 3 0 5 0 1))
