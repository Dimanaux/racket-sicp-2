# racket-sicp-2
My solutions for exercises of the second chapter of SICP.

First chapter is [here](https://github.com/Dimanaux/racket-sicp).

Project is aimed to walk through SICP exercises and develop us as programmers, as mathematicians.
SICP includes exercises, that can make our brains work hard to figure out the solution.

It can be useful for those, who doesn't want/can't to solve SICP's exercises themselves.

You can start with SICP. It is availiable for free [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-13.html#%_chap_2).
To run tests, play with code in REPL or run programs in Racket download it [here](https://racket-lang.org/) (full, not minimal).
Run tests using `raco test test/exercise-2.xx.rkt` (for specific test) or `raco test test/*` (for all tests).
Every solution file contains it's problem and also can contain some notes.
